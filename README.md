# database-dev-course

This repository contains work done during my university database course.

For the project I am using `PostgreSQL` for the `sql` section and `MongoDB` for the `nosql` section.

The project documentation is written in the Polish language, as specified, by the course requirements.

The course materials are publicly available [here](dsc.pollub.pl/sql).
